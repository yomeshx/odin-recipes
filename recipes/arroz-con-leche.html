            This Arroz con Leche is the Cuban version of rice pudding. It's richer and sweeter than regular rice pudding.
            Being Cuban myself, I prefer this version of this delicious dessert to any other.
            Before serving,sprinkle with cinnamon or garnish with a cinnamon stick, for flair.

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine 2 1/4 cups of water, rice, and lime peel in a saucepan.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes until the rice is tender.</li>
            <li>While the rice is cooking, combine 1/2 cup of water, the cinnamon stick, and anise in another saucepan over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Bring mixture to a low boil for 3 minutes, then remove saucepan from stove.</li>
            <li>Strain flavored water into a bowl and set aside, discarding cinnamon stick and anise pieces.</li>
            <li>After rice has simmered for 20 minutes, carefully remove the lime peel with a slotted spoon, and over low heat, gradually stir evaporated milk and condensed milk into the rice. </li>
            <li> Mix in the cinnamon and anise-flavored water, vanilla, and salt. Add raisins, if desired. Continue to stir until the mixture thickens, about 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>If the pudding is too watery after 10 minutes, turn up heat to medium-low and stir continuously. </li>
            <li>When pudding reaches desired consistency, remove from heat and pour into individual dishes, or a large bowl. Store in the refrigerator until ready to serve.</li>
